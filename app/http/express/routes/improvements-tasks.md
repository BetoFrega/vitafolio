# Routes Architecture Improvement Tasks

## üéØ Current Progress Status

**Phase 1 Foundation: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

- All shared infrastructure components implemented
- Response types, BaseHandler, AuthenticatedHandler, RequestValidator complete
- Health routes module completed as pilot implementation

**Phase 2 Current Task: Task 2.3 - Collections Module Structure (NEXT)**

- Task 2.2 - Auth Routes Module: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- E2E test coverage complete: debug/auth, login, register endpoints
- All auth handlers implemented and tested

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**

- Breaking changes implemented: Standardized response format to `{ success: true/false, data/error: T, timestamp: string }`
- All routes require E2E test coverage - this is mandatory
- TDD approach: E2E tests first, then implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the incremental tasks needed to implement the routes architecture improvements. All tasks follow TDD principles, introduce no breaking changes, and maintain backward compatibility throughout the migration.

## üö® CRITICAL: E2E Test Coverage Requirement

**EVERY ROUTE MUST HAVE E2E TEST COVERAGE**

All tasks that involve creating or modifying routes MUST include corresponding E2E tests. This is mandatory and non-negotiable. See `/app/_tests/E2E_COVERAGE_TRACKER.md` for current coverage status.

### TDD Workflow for Route Tasks:

1. **E2E Tests First (RED)**: Write E2E tests before implementation
2. **Implementation (GREEN)**: Implement to pass E2E tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping E2E tests green

## üö® Current E2E Coverage Gaps

**Missing E2E Test Coverage** (remaining gaps):

- ‚úÖ `GET /debug/auth` - **COMPLETED** (included in auth.e2e.test.ts)
- ‚ùå `GET /api/v1/notifications` - Currently skipped, needs enabling
- ‚ùå `GET /api/v1/items/search` - Missing search endpoint tests

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes Implemented

**Response Format Standardization**:

- **OLD**: Inconsistent formats like `{ error: "message" }` or `{ ok: true }`
- **NEW**: Standardized `{ success: true/false, data/error: {...}, timestamp: string }`
- **Impact**: Tests will need updates during handler migration

## Task Categories

- üîß **Infrastructure** - Foundation components
- üß™ **Testing** - Test infrastructure and utilities (including E2E)
- üîÑ **Migration** - Converting existing code
- üßπ **Cleanup** - Removing deprecated code

- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] Type safety enhanced
- [ ] Code duplication reduced

### Quality Requirements

## üìã Important Architecture Reminders

### Authentication & Middleware

- Authentication middleware: `/app/http/express/middleware/makeAuthenticationMiddleware.ts`
- Use Result pattern: `result.isSuccess()`, `result.getValue()`, etc.
- AuthenticatedRequest interface matches auth middleware expectations

### Path Structure Constraints

- Keep `/api/v1/` structure during migration
- No path changes in current phase
- Health endpoint special case: Returns `{ ok: true }` in data field

### Testing Requirements

- All tests must pass during migration - fix broken tests immediately
- E2E test coverage is mandatory for ALL routes
- TDD approach: E2E tests first, then implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### Parallel Implementation Strategy

- Keep old handlers functional during migration
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain backward compatibility at all times
- Comprehensive testing at each phase

### Rollback Plan

- Migration utility supports rollback
- Old handlers remain available until final cleanup
- Feature flags allow instant rollback if issues arise
- Monitoring to detect any regressions quickly

### Testing Strategy

- TDD approach ensures quality from start
- Integration tests verify no regressions
- Performance tests prevent degradation
- End-to-end tests validate complete workflows
