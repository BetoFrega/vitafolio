# Vitafolio

Vitafolio is a prototype personal organization application designed to simplify everyday life management.

## Overview

The central idea is simple: everything is an item that belongs to a collection. Books, board games, pantry food, assets, and even pets can be represented as items. Each collection enriches items with relevant metadata, enabling better organization and actionable insights.

### Examples of Collections and Metadata

- A `book` in the `library` collection can have:
  - Title
  - Author
  - ISBN
- A `tomato` in the `fridge` collection can have:
  - Quantity
  - Unit
  - Expiration date
- An `air conditioner` in the `appliances` collection can have:
  - Recurring maintenance rules

### Actionable Metadata

Metadata is not just descriptive; it drives actions:

- **Expiration dates**: Generate consumption or disposal reminders.
- **Maintenance rules**: Schedule recurring tasks.
- **Ownership status**: Track and manage personal collections.

## Key Features

Vitafolio provides an integrated view of everything that needs to be managed daily:

- **Personal Collections**: Books, games, and more.
- **Household Pantry**: Stock levels and expiration tracking.
- **Assets and Maintenance**: Recurring tasks and detailed records.

All features are designed to be flexible and practical, supporting both information recording and actionable task management.

## Design Philosophy

- **Flexibility**: Adapts to diverse needs and item types.
- **Simplicity**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **Action-Oriented**: Focuses on managing tasks and events, not just storing data.
- **Integration**: Centralized access to all collections and items.
- **Automation**: Automates reminders and recurring actions whenever possible.
