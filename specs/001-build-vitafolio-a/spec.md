# Feature Specification: Core Life Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-vitafolio-a`  
**Created**: September 9, 2025  
**Status**: Ready  
**Input**: User description: "Build Vitafolio, a Life Management application for making life management easier. The central idea is simple: everything is an item that belongs to a collection. Books, board games, pantry food, assets, and even pets can be represented as items. Each collection enriches items with relevant metadata, enabling better organization and actionable insights."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description provided: Core life management system with items and collections
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users managing personal items
   ‚Üí Actions: Create collections, add items, view items, organize with metadata
   ‚Üí Data: Items, collections, metadata attributes
   ‚Üí Constraints: Flexible schema for different item types
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User authentication and account management requirements]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Multi-user support or single-user application?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data persistence requirements and storage location]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Create collection ‚Üí Add items ‚Üí Organize with metadata ‚Üí View/manage items
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on core collection and item management capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Item, Collection, Metadata
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All clarifications resolved in functional requirements
   ‚Üí No implementation details present
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a person with various possessions and responsibilities, I want to organize everything I own and manage into collections with relevant details, so that I can easily track, find, and take action on my belongings when needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I want to organize my books, **When** I create a "Library" collection and add a book item with title, author, and ISBN, **Then** I can view the book with all its details in my library collection
2. **Given** I have food items in my pantry, **When** I create a "Pantry" collection and add a tomato with quantity and expiration date, **Then** I can track what food I have and when it expires
3. **Given** I own household appliances, **When** I create an "Appliances" collection and add an air conditioner with maintenance schedule metadata, **Then** I can track when maintenance is needed
4. **Given** I have multiple collections with various items, **When** I view my collections overview, **Then** I can see all my collections and navigate between them easily
5. **Given** I have items with actionable metadata, **When** the system processes expiration dates or maintenance schedules, **Then** I receive appropriate notifications or reminders

### Edge Cases

- What happens when I try to add an item without a collection first?
- How does the system handle items with missing or incomplete metadata?
- What occurs when I delete a collection that contains items?
- How does the system manage different metadata types for the same item category?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create named collections for organizing items
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to add items to existing collections
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to define custom metadata fields for each collection type
- **FR-004**: System MUST store and display item details including name and collection-specific metadata
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a way to view all collections and their items
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to edit item details and metadata after creation
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to delete items from collections
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to delete collections (with appropriate warnings for non-empty collections)
- **FR-009**: System MUST support different metadata types (text, numbers, dates, boolean values)
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist user data between application sessions
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist user account and authentication details in a safe manner, no matter where it is stored
- **FR-012**: System MUST support multiple users per instance and multiple households
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a way to search or filter items across collections
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle actionable metadata like expiration dates and maintenance schedules
- **FR-015**: System MUST deliver notifications or reminders based on actionable metadata (e.g., upcoming expirations, maintenance due dates) in multiple formats (e.g., email, in-app) which can be extended or customized by the user using plugins or integrations

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Collection**: The primary organizing entity that defines the schema and metadata structure for items. Each collection (e.g., Library, Pantry, Appliances) has a name, description, and specifies what metadata fields are required or available for items within that collection. Collections act as templates that determine what information can be captured about their items.
- **Item**: Individual things being managed that conform to their collection's metadata schema. Each item has a name, belongs to exactly one collection, and contains metadata values that match the fields defined by its parent collection.
- **Metadata**: The structured attributes defined by collections and populated by items. These flexible key-value pairs can be different data types (text, number, date, boolean) and drive actionable insights like expiration tracking or maintenance scheduling.
- **User**: Represents an individual using the system, with authentication credentials and personal data. Users can create and manage multiple collections and items, and their data must be securely stored and isolated from other users.
- **Notification**: Represents alerts or reminders generated based on actionable metadata. Notifications can be configured to be sent via different channels (e.g., email, in-app) and can be customized by the user.
- **Plugin**: Represents an extendable component that adds custom functionality or integrations to the system. Users can install and configure plugins to enhance their experience and tailor the system to their needs.
